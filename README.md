uhc-utils
=========

Utilities required by UHC (Utrecht Haskell Compiler)


status/disclamer
================

Currently the source code is just factored out of UHC, minimally
commented, all modules in UHC.Util, not yet properly spread using naming
conventions. Also, some of the modules have become obsolete over time,
so will someday be removed, to be replaced by other libraries. In other
words, the library is intended for UHC only.
